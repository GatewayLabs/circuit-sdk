/// A trait that defines a set of logical and arithmetic operations to be implemented for a custom circuit executor type.
///
/// This trait is designed to provide generic functionality for various kinds of operations
/// that work on individual types and vectors of types. The trait assumes the existence of two
/// associated types:
/// - `Type`: Represents an individual element used in operations.
/// - `TypeVec`: Represents a vector of `Type`, used for operations on collections.
///
/// # Associated Types
///
/// - Type: The base type for individual operations.
/// - TypeVec: A vector of the base type, used for operations involving collections.
///
/// # Required Methods
///
/// Each method must be implemented to provide the desired functionality.
